## Purpose

This replicates `UIActionSheet` behavior, but using a `UIViewController` instead of a simple view. It also mimics the look and feel of iOS 7 action sheets.

Using a view controller gives the benefits of view controllers containers, auto-rotation.

* iOS 7 style brought to iOS 6
* Block callbacks
* Colors are customizable
* Auto-rotation
* Arbitrary number of items
* **Requires ARC** (use `-fobjc-arc` on non-ARC projects)
* Uses UIKit view controller containment

## Use

Present:

````objc
CAPPSActionSheetViewController *asvc = [[CAPPSActionSheetViewController alloc]
                                            initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
    
[asvc setTitle:@"Action Sheet title"];
[asvc addButtonWithTitle:@"Option 1" block:^{
    // Action to perform on tap   
}];
[asvc addButtonWithTitle:@"Option 2" block:^{
    // Action to perform on tap   
}];
// ...
    
[asvc presentInViewController:self completion:nil];
````

and dismiss:

````objc
[asvc dismiss:^{ /* â€¦  */ }];

````
